My name is Grigory Shepelev (that combines to my username @shegeley in a weird way). 

I am a math student and a lazy enthusiast of functional programming, living in Belgorod, Russia. 

Mostly interested in lisp-like languages (guile, clojure) although played with Haskell a little. Somewhat familiar with docker and web development. 

Besides I love podcasts, reading, running and some parts of DIY.
