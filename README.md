My name is Grigory Shepelev. I am a math student and function programming enthusiast, living in Belgorod, Russia. 

I love avocados, asian cuisine, travels, podcasts. A lazy enthusiast of Linux, open source, functional programming, Haskel/Clojure.  

I enjoy functional programming and some parts of math. Played with Haskell a little but now interested in Clojure/ClojureScript. Somewhat familiar with docker, web development and telegram api. Sometimes hanging on CodingGame and solving puzzles.
