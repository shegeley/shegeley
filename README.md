My name is Grigory Shepelev (that combines to my username @shegeley in a weird way). 

I am a math bachelor and a lazy enthusiast of functional programming, living in Belgorod, Russia. 

Mostly interested in lisp-like languages (Clojure, Scheme, Common Lisp) although played with Haskell a little. Somewhat familiar with docker and web development. 

Fan of reproducibility and stability. Using [RDE-flawored](https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/rde) [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) operating system

Besides I enjoy meditation, reading, running and general physical keeping-in-shape stuff, some DIY and learning digital drawing with Krita.
