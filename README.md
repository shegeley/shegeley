My name is Grigory Shepelev (that combines to my username @shegeley in a weird way). 

I am a math bachelor and a lazy enthusiast of functional programming, living in Belgorod, Russia. 

Mostly interested in lisp-like languages (Clojure, Guile) although played with Haskell a little. Somewhat familiar with docker and web development. 

Fan of reproducibility and stability. Using GNU Guix operating system.

Active user of Doom Emacs. 

Besides I enjoy meditation, podcasts, reading, running and general physical keeping-in-shape stuff, and some parts of DIY.
