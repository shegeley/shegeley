My name is Grigory Shepelev (that combines to my username @shegeley in a weird way). 

I am a math student and a lazy enthusiast of functional programming, living in Belgorod, Russia. 

Mostly interested in lisp-like languages (Clojure, Racket, Guile, Elisp) although played with Haskell a little. Somewhat familiar with docker and web development. 

Fan of reproducibility and stability. Using GuixOS.

Active user of Emacs (Doom Emacs). 

Besides I enjoy meditation, somewhat politics, podcasts, reading, running and general physical keeping-in-shape stuff, and some parts of DIY.
